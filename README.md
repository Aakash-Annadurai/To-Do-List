## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React



### What I learned

React is complex and yet easy to use once you grasp the concept. I learned to Divide components and how to use hooks for State change.

### Continued development

CSS and styling in general is still a challenge for me. So, Practicing styling is my top priority for now.


### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/ - This is an amazing page which helped me finally understand what syntax to use for each case. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this HTML, CSS, React.
